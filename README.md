# *Project Veda*

## Overview

Veda is an ingenious companion, drawing inspiration from the iconic JARVIS from the Marvel universe, particularly Tony Stark's ingenuity in using technology to conquer challenges and boost productivity. The concept of Veda sprang from my fascination with the notion of having a personal AI companion, and let's be honest, which MCU fan wouldn't be intrigued by the idea of having their own JARVIS? I was just 4 years old when Iron Man came out and Tony Stark and his technology inspired me to get into this field in the first place so what better way to honor that than by creating this companion?

Finding a name was the first crucial step, essential to encapsulate the essence of my companion. Following meticulous research, "Veda" surfaced as the ideal choice. Its origin in Sanskrit, meaning 'knowledge,' perfectly mirrors Veda's core mission of empowering users with information and assistance in their daily lives. Just like her fictional counterpart, Veda strives to make lives easier.
